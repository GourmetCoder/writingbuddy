This is an example text, it is way too short to actually display how to use this program though, as in it will generate errors sometimes. I should actually fix those instead of leaving them in but this is the first version of the program and with large text data it will very rarely affect the usability of the program, and even in the rare cases where it does, the user can just run the code again. Anyhow have fun using the program, I hope you find it useful. It's code is actually quite a bit cleaner than what I usually produce.
